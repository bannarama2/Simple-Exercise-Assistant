## Simple Exercise Bot - Your Workout Buddy
Welcome to my Simple Exercise Bot repository! In this repository, I present a fun and quick project that resulted in an AI-inspired exercise bot. This bot aims to provide exercise recommendations for different muscle groups based on user inputs. It's a testament to my early exploration of coding and a snapshot of what I could achieve in just under an hour and 30 minutes.

## Overview
This Python script introduces you to a friendly AI exercise bot. Here's how it works:

The bot begins by prompting you for input.
If you greet the bot (e.g., "Hi!" or "Hello!"), it responds with its own greetings.
If you seek advice, help, or guidance with exercising (using keywords like "advice," "help," or "pointers"), the bot eagerly offers assistance.
Depending on the input, the bot can provide exercise recommendations for specific muscle groups, including back, chest, legs, biceps, and triceps.
When you're ready to wrap up the interaction, use keywords like "Stop," "Close," or "End" to bid farewell to the bot.
Achievements
I'm proud to share that this project earned me first place in a competition, showcasing my early coding skills and creativity. It's a testament to what can be achieved with Python and a bit of imagination.

## Usage
Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Open your terminal and navigate to the repository's directory.
Run the Python script using python exercise_bot.py.
Interact with the bot by typing different inputs and exploring its responses.
Use the appropriate keywords to gracefully end the conversation.

## Acknowledgments
This project was a result of my initial learning journey, created before I delved into the realms of AI and ML. While I can't trace back the exact sources, I'd like to extend my gratitude to the online communities and resources that fueled my early exploration.

Feel free to engage with the bot, modify the code, or simply use it as a unique conversation piece that adds a touch of whimsy to your programming experiences.

Feel free to adjust this description as needed to match your style and the specifics of your repository. The goal is to encapsulate the essence of your project and your journey while providing clear instructions for usage and engagement.
